# A decaf compiler in C++

This is a Decaf Compiler which I implemented in C++. This is the project of the compiler design and principle instructed by Dr Mohammad Reza Bahrami. The course material is available [here](http://ce.sharif.edu/~mrbahrami/courses/CompilerFall21.html).

## How the compiler works?

It uses the `flex` to tokenize the inputs, then the tokenized input is given to `bison` to be parsed. Finally `bison` calls our codegens available 
in the `codegen` subdirectory. 


## What does the `run.sh` do?

It first runs uses `cmake` to create the build files. Then `make` is used to build the project. Finally `spim` is used to simulate the `mips` assembly generated by us to check whether the given tests are passed or not.  

## What is needed for builing the project?
+ `cmake`
+ `make`
+ `flex`
+ `bison`


## What is to be done?
+ Implementing recursion.
+ Fixing bugs.
